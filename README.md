Monty_hall is basically a game🎮 wherein a host comes and asks the player to choose one door among the three.
The host knows what is behind each door.Two of the doors have goats🐐 and only one of them contain the reward in it which is car in this case🚘.
Now, the player selects a door🚪.Now monty chooses a door eliminating a door which has a goat.
Now he asks the player to stay or switch bewtween the doors.And this game provides a statistical proof that the probability of player winning 🏆 the game is more when he/she switches rather than staying!!:)
